    "This should be a self contained notebook which can be run top to bottom each week. The output should be 5-10 companies which can be logged and their performance recorded as a paper test. The notebook should be run on a weekend, the idea being that if productionised, it would be run friday night before market close.\n",
    "The order of operations should be:\n",
    "1) Scrape historic data, save to a holding directory\n",
    "2) Resample the data to be weekly such that the entire current week is considered as the most up to date data point\n",
    "3) Attach relevant technical indicators and resave in another directory. This should be a modular process in case I want to add technical indicators in the future. Currently the RSI, MFI, ULT and my personal volume ranker are used.\n",
    "4) For the most recent month, rank order all companies by the indicator scores, take 3 from each and combine them for unique codes\n"

    "The data we have scraped is daily. There are a few issues with this. One issue is that there is no guarantee that any ticker has the same days in it as any other. Some may have data which ends sooner or starts later. To get around most of the issues, we can use a merge function on the date index to combine them and have nulls for the missings, which is fine for our purposes. Additionally, we dont want to process daily data as its less useful to weekly resampling gives us appropriate data for the sort of technical indicators we are playing with. Lastly, we want the resample to cap off at the most recent Friday so final date in the output should be the last Friday."

    "We need standardised measures of stocks which can be rank ordered in a way where the ranking of the indicator relative to the wider market gives us value. Good example is RSI where the most overbought companies in the Nasdaq and NYSE have significant positive sentiment behind them when the data was taken. Backtests verify that this sentiment tends to continue more often than it reverses so using it as a leading indicator of stock price growth works over the long term. MFI is a normalised version of my original indicator which just multiplies volume into adj close and rank orders."
